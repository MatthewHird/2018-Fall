    1: Overview

Program that allows a user to input commands to interact with a social
influence graph. This graph contains a number of users, and connects them based
on the influence each user has other users. The edges of the graph are both
directional and weighted (edges have a value of 1 for positive influence and -1
for negative influences). The program is started by calling the run
(std::string filePath) public method. When the program starts, the file at
filePath is read and used to populate the graph. When the program is exited
through the "quit" command, the data contained in the graph is saved in
filePath, overwriting the file. 


    2: Design

This program contains the main function; on primary control class,
SocialInfluenceAnalyzer; a directed, weighted graph, InfluenceGraph, that
contains a class Edge; and seven
exception classes that all inherit from std::exception.


    3: Implementation

InfluenceGraph was implemented using adjacency lists to track the edges. Each
list contains Edge objects. Edges contain the index of the destination vertex
and a distance value (weight). The lists are maintained in an array where the index represents the source vertex.

The positiveLink and userOutreach methods in InfluenceGraph were implemented 
using an iterative breadth first search. This allowed userOutreach to find all 
connected users by creating a spanning tree, while also letting positiveLink
find the shortest positive path.


    4: Accomplishment

I have completed all parts of the assignment that were listed under the "Problem
Description" and the "Design and Documentation" sections of the Programming
Assignment 3 web page.
