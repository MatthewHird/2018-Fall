Tree ADTs: 
    General Tree
        Traversal
            Inorder: Left, Root, Right
            Preorder: Root, Left, Right
            Postorder: Left, Right, Root

    Binary Search Tree
        Performance
            All Operations: O(h) -> Avg O(logn), Worst Case O(n)

    AVL Tree
        Properties
            Self balancing BST
            The difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes.

        Performance
            All Operations: Worst Case O(logn)

    Thread Tree
        Properties
            Makes inorder traversal faster without stack or recursion. 
            All right child pointers that would normally be NULL point to the inorder successor of the node (if it exists).

        Implementation
            Single Threaded: 
                Each node is threaded towards either the in-order predecessor or successor (left or right)

            Double Threaded: 
                Each node is threaded towards both the in-order predecessor and successor (left and right)
                    The predecessor threads are useful for reverse inorder traversal and postorder traversal.
                    The threads are also useful for fast accessing ancestors of a node.
    
    Red Black Tree
        Properties
            Every Red Black Tree with n nodes has height <= 2Log2(n+1)
            Balance Properties
                1) Every node is either red or black.
                2) The root node is always black.
                3) There are no two adjacent red nodes.
                4) Every path from a nodeto any of its descendant NULL nodes has the same number of black nodes.

        Performance
            All Operations: Worst Case O(logn)
            

    (2,4)-Tree
        Properties
            Grow and shrink from the root.
            All leaves on same level.
            Every node must contain 1-3 keys.
            Internal nodes must have key + 1 children.
            Nodes are sorted in ascending order
            Child pointer between two keys k1 and k2 contains all keys from range k1 to k2

        Performance
            All Operations: Avg and Worst Case O(logn)

    Dijkstra's Algorithm
        1) Create a set sptSet (shortest path tree set) that keeps track of vertices included in shortest path tree, i.e., whose minimum distance from source is calculated and finalized. Initially, this set is empty.
        2) Assign a distance value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all distance values as INFINITE. Assign distance value as 0 for the source vertex so that it is picked first.
        3) While sptSet doesn’t include all vertices
            a) Pick a vertex u which is not there in sptSet and has minimum distance value.
            b) Include u to sptSet.
            c) Update distance value of all adjacent vertices of u. To update the distance values, iterate through all adjacent vertices. For every adjacent vertex v, if sum of distance value of u (from source) and weight of edge u-v, is less than the distance value of v, then update the distance value of v.
