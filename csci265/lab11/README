Lab 11
======

The objective in this lab is to develop a perl gtk gui to allow
the user access to run the buildStatusHash function (from lab 8)
and display the resulting hash table contents.

The look and feel of the interface is left to the student's
discretion, the only restriction being that the user should
be able to use the gtk file browsing widget when picking files.

You may use either your own lab 8 implementations of the functions
or the posted sample solutions.

The repository contains a sample perl gtk script, in file gtk.pl.
