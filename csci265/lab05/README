Lab 05
======

This repository contains a collection of C and C++ header files (.h),
object files (.o), and source code files (.c and .C), divided into several
directories:

    key: contains files related to capturing keypresses
    server: contains files related to server-side code
    client: contains files related to client-side code
    doc: contains documentation for an old network lab
         (the original source for the code used here).
         The content there is for information only, you do
         NOT need to do any of the actions discussed there.

Originally the files were all in a single directory, and the various commands
used to build the object and executable files were:

   # to make tcpServer.o and the tcpServer executable
   g++ -Wall -c tcpServer.c -o tcpServer.o
   g++ -Wall -o tcpServer tcpServer.o

   # to make tcpClient.o and the tcpClient executable
   g++ -Wall -c tcpClient.c -o tcpClient.o
   g++ -Wall -o tcpClient tcpClient.o

   # to make client.o and the client executable
   g++ -Wall -c client.C -o client.o
   g++ -Wall -o client client.o

   # to make keyPress.o, server.o, and the server executable
   g++ -Wall -c keyPress.C -o keyPress.o
   g++ -Wall -c server.C -o server.o
   g++ -Wall -o server server.o keyPress.o

Your task is to finish the makefile included in this repository,
so it correctly recompiles executables and object files as needed,
taking into account the dependencies between files and the new
directory structure.

Note that each object files depends on one C/C++ file and an
associated header file, and that each executable depends on its
associated object file EXCEPT the server executable, which also
depends on the keyPress object file.

At the moment the only rule in the makefile is the "all" rule,
which must remain as the "top" target in your makefile, so the
user can ensure everything is up to date (if they so choose) by
simply typing make.

You must also include a "clean" target, which specifically removes
the .o files created above.  (Do NOT use *.o in your remove command.)

You must also configure your makefile to use the following variables
to simplify later changes to the makefile compiler, assembler, or options:
CC=g++
Options=-Wall
(You may use any additional variables you find convenient.)

Be sure your makefile works, and only recompiles what is absolutely necessary.

For testing purposes, it is recommended you use the command
    touch filename
which alters the modification date for the specified file without
needing to actually edit it.

   E.g. I could run make all, then touch keyPress.h and run make again
   to see if it compiles just the necessary files rather than all of them.

Notes on the programs themselves:

   While you don't really need to understand the program or what the various functions
   are doing, you are more than welcome to see if the programs still actually work.
