# Lab 4
# =====

# task: to create a script named showAccess.sh that allows the
#       user to specify a starting directory as a command line argument,
#       then displays all its subdirectories (and their subdirectories
#       and so on) that are both executable and readable, and will
#       in turn recursively explore those subdirectories
#
# usage:
#    the user runs the script with the directory as an argument, e.g.
#        ./showAccess.sh dirname
#    (directory names may include paths)
#
# recommendation:
#    create a recursive function to carry out the actual exploration,
#        and have the script call the function, passing the command
#        line argument
#
# exception handling:
#    if an incorrect number of command line arguments is provided
#       a suitable error message is displayed and the script ends
#    note that an invalid starting directory name should not cause
#       the script to crash, nor should locked directories cause the
#       script to crash

# example:
#    suppose we have the following directory structure
#    (showing only the directories here, not files)
#
#         myproject
#        /    |    \
#      code  docs   bin
#     /   \
#   hdrs  src
#
# suppose the directories are all readable and executable except
#     src, which is not executable, and
#     bin, which is not readable
#
# then if the script is run as
#
#    showAccess.sh myproject
#
# the output might look something like:
#
#    List of accessible directories within myproject:
#       Accessible directory: myproject
#       Accessible directory: myproject/code
#       Accessible directory: myproject/code/hdrs
#       Accessible directory: myproject/docs
#    end of list
